# N-body simulation in OpenCV

A visualisation of N-body physics in C++ using OpenCV library to visualise particles and their interactions.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo into your folder

    `git clone https://github.com/sanjeev309/n-body-opencv.git `

- Make changes if any to main.cpp
- Execute make command to compile into an executable
