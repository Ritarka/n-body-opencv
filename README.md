
# N-body simulation in OpenCV

A visualization of N-body physics in C++ using OpenCV library to visualize particles and their interactions.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo into your folder

    `git clone https://github.com/sanjeev309/n-body-opencv.git `

- Make changes if any to main.cpp
- Execute make command to compile into an executable

    `make compile`

- Run the executable

    `./n_body_opencv`

- Clean for a rebuild

    `make clean`

### Prerequisites

OpenCV 3.2 installation and header files.


### Demonstration
